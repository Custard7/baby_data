In the haze of sleep deprivation, it can be difficult to remember when the baby last ate or how long ago you changed her. A friend recommended the [Feed Baby app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/feed-baby-breastfeeding-app/id868611155) to track diaper changes, feeds, sleep, weight, and so on, and we immediately traded in the pen + paper tracker provided by the hospital for a digital tracker. As a data nerd, I also assumed I'd be able to use the meticulously tracked data to better understand my baby and maybe even figure out how to make her sleep longer (LOL). 


```{r, out.width = "250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/feedbaby_screenshot.png")
```

The app also has a feature that lets you download the data as several .csv files (one for sleep, one for feeds, etc). Here's a look at the `sleep.csv` export.   

```{r inspect_feedbaby}
str(feedbaby_raw)
```

### Preprocessing the data  

First, I split sessions into individual days (e.g. sessions crossing over midnight would become one ending at 11:59 PM and a second one starting at 12:00 AM). For cleaner visualiztion, I then shifted the times to allow for a plot with the x axis beginning at 7 AM rather than 12 AM to more clearly delineate day and night sleeps.  


```{r functions}
date_shift_and_split <- function(df,
                                 start_time_numeric = 'start_time_numeric', 
                                 end_time_numeric = 'end_time_numeric',
                                 shifted_day_start = 7) {
  
  shifted_df <- df %>%
    mutate(start_time_shift = ifelse(!! sym(start_time_numeric) < shifted_day_start, !! sym(start_time_numeric) + 24, !! sym(start_time_numeric)),
           end_time_shift = ifelse(!! sym(end_time_numeric) < shifted_day_start, !! sym(end_time_numeric) + 24, !! sym(end_time_numeric)),
           start_date_shift = as.Date(ifelse(start_time_shift >= 24, start_date - lubridate::days(1), start_date), origin = '1970-01-01'),
           end_date_shift = as.Date(ifelse(end_time_shift >= 24, end_date - lubridate::days(1), end_date), origin = '1970-01-01'),
           split = ifelse(start_date_shift != end_date_shift, 'original', NA)

                                        TRUE ~ start_time_shift)

## Newborn sleep  

Some important details:  

- I am very lucky to be home with my daughter full time for 18 weeks. Because of COVID-19, we started limiting social visits, errands, and basically most leaving the house except for doctor appointments when she was 8 weeks old. When she was 10 weeks old, a stay-at-home order was enacted in Minnesota, and is still in effect. Because we spent 99% of our time at home and have no other children, we were able to let her dictate when to eat, nap, play, etc., rather than trying to conform her to our schedule, so her sleep is likely the best it could possibly be for her!
- She is breastfed so she needs to eat more frequently than a formula or combination-fed baby.  
- We didn't start tracking reliably until we came home from the hopsital, so those dates are greyed out.  


```{r all_sleeps, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 10}
feedbaby_sleep_processed %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = start_time_shift, 
                   xend = end_time_shift, 
                   y = weeks_old, 
                   yend = weeks_old,
                   color = type), 
               size = 3) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 7, xmax = 31, ymin = 0, ymax = 3/7), fill = 'grey60') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(7,13,19,25,31), 
                     labels = c('7AM', '1PM', '7PM', '1AM', '7AM')) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12)) +
  labs(title = 'Newborn sleep', 
       subtitle = 'Tracked using the Feed Baby app',
       x = 'Time', 
       y = 'Weeks old') +
  scale_color_kp(palette = "cool", reverse = TRUE) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="grey80"),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())
```

You can see how disordered the first few weeks were, with just about as much day sleep as night sleep. Luckily, her night sleep showed steady improvements over time. While she wasn't keen on daytime sleep, she didn't have her days and nights mixed up for very long. We got our first glorious 5 hour stretch at the end of week 3, and the first signs of being able to sleep through the night between 6-8 weeks. 

From weeks 3 to 10, she averaged only two naps a day that were on the longer side (1-2.5 hours), and could happen at any time. No clear pattern emerged until about week 11, when she started taking short 30-60 minute naps 4-5 times a day.  

How many hours does that add up to each day?

```{r feedbaby_total, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5}
feedbaby_sleep_processed %>%
  mutate(duration_hours = end_time_shift - start_time_shift) %>% 
  group_by(weeks_old, type) %>%
  summarise(total_hours = sum(duration_hours)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weeks_old, y = total_hours)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16)) +
  labs(title = 'Total hours of sleep',
       x = 'Weeks old',
       y = 'Hours') +
  scale_fill_kp(palette = "cool", reverse = TRUE)
```

Since birth, she's averaged about 12 hours of sleep each day, much less than the [14-17 hours per day](https://www.sleephealthjournal.org/article/S2352-7218(15)00015-7/fulltext) found to be typical for newborns. We expected to need to wake her up to eat and have her snooze anywhere, but she turned out to be a very alert baby! Over time, it's slowly shifted to be more hours at night and less during the day.  

How long could she sleep at a time? 

```{r feedbaby_longest, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 5}
feedbaby_sleep_processed %>%
  mutate(duration_hours = end_time_shift - start_time_shift) %>% 
  group_by(start_date_shift, weeks_old, type) %>%
  summarise(longest_stretch = max(duration_hours)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weeks_old, y = longest_stretch)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = type)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12)) +
  labs(title = 'Longest stretch of sleep',
       subtitle = 'Feed Baby',
       x = 'Weeks old',
       y = 'Hours') +
  scale_color_kp(palette = "cool", reverse = TRUE)
```

There's a pretty clear trend of increasing sleep duration at night and decreasing duration during the day. She gradually expanded her longest stretch from ~2.5 hours in the beginning to 8 by week 8 or so, and then had a bit of a regression, likely corresponding to a growth spurt or Wonder Week. At the same time, her naps got shorter and shorter until they lasted just a single sleep cycle. 


#### Snoo  

One particularly challenging night, we decided to rent a Snoo, a [smart bassinet](https://www.happiestbaby.com/pages/snoo) that responsively rocks and plays white noise to extend your baby's sleep. It came with an app that displayed each stretch of sleep and how long/when the bassinet ramped up its soothing measures to quiet a fussy baby.  

```{r, out.width = "250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/snoo_screenshot.jpg")
```

I was excited to see that you can access your Snoo data using the [Python package `Snoo`](https://pypi.org/project/snoo/).  

```{r inspect_snoo}
str(snoo_raw)
```

While I credit the constantly gentle motion of the Snoo for helping her sleep longer, the higher-motion, higher-volume white-noise "soothing" levels triggered by noise and movement (fussing) were never able to calm her back to sleep. Basically, if she woke up enough to trigger the soothing, she wasn't going to go back to sleep without parent intervention. Because we didn't find them to be impactful, I have disregarded them here. Also, the data only tells you total time spent soothing vs. asleep with no indication of when the soothing happened, if it was multiple soothing sessions, etc., so I don't think it would be very useful to analyze anyway.  

```{r snoo}
snoo_sleep <- snoo_raw %>%
  mutate(start_datetime = as.POSIXct(gsub('T', ' ', start_time)),
         end_datetime = as.POSIXct(gsub('T', ' ', end_time)),
         start_date = as.Date(start_time),
         end_date = as.Date(end_time),
         start_time = sapply(start_time, function(x) strsplit(x, 'T')[[1]][2]),
         end_time = sapply(end_time, function(x) strsplit(x, 'T')[[1]][2]),
         start_time_numeric = as.numeric(substring(start_time, 1, 2)) + as.numeric(substring(start_time, 4, 5))/60,
         end_time_numeric = as.numeric(substring(end_time, 1, 2)) + as.numeric(substring(end_time, 4, 5))/60,
         location = 'snoo'
  ) %>%
  select(c('start_datetime', 'end_datetime', 'start_date', 'end_date', 'start_time_numeric', 'end_time_numeric', 'location'))

snoo_sleep_processed <- preprocess_sleep(snoo_sleep)

str(snoo_sleep_processed)
```

```{r snoo_sleeps, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 8 }
feedbaby_sleep_processed %>%
  rbind(snoo_sleep_processed) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = start_time_shift, 
                   xend = end_time_shift, 
                   y = weeks_old, 
                   yend = weeks_old,
                   color = location), 
               size = 3) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 7, xmax = 31, ymin = 0, ymax = 3/7), fill = 'grey60') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(7,13,19,25,31), 
                     labels = c('7AM', '1PM', '7PM', '1AM', '7AM')) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12)) +
  labs(title = 'Newborn sleep', 
       subtitle = 'Began using the Snoo for night sleep ~5 weeks; naps varied',
       x = 'Time', 
       y = 'Weeks old') +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('grey80', '#2F7C9F')) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="grey80"),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

```

For the first five weeks, she mostly slept on us or in her regular bassinet, with varying degrees of success. Once we got the Snoo set up, we spent a week or so acclimating her to it (at first she hated the motion) and then shifted her into it for all night sleep. We still held her for most naps because she would only sleep about 45 minutes in the Snoo, but we could extend her naps longer if we held her. Around 10 weeks, her naps got short no matter if we held her or not, so we tried moving them into the Snoo, but didn't get successful until week 12 or so. 

There is some variance between the Feed Baby and Snoo sleep sessions because Feed Baby is tracked manually, while the Snoo automatically records each time it is turned on. Sometimes she would fall asleep for a while before being placed in the Snoo, or wake up right when we tried to set her down. I tried to keep the Feed Baby sessions accurate to her actual sleep time, while the Snoo is more a measure of when the bassinet was turned on.
